# Image-to-Text-Response-with-RAG
This project is a web application that allows users to upload an image, process it to extract details, and then interact with the application by asking questions about the image. The application uses the Salesforce BLIP model for image captioning and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for generating responses to user queries.
